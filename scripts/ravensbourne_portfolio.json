This led me to learn about OpenGL, and I quickly found some lessons on how it worked. After some time, I decided to make a rendering engine. <em> Breeze Render Engine </em> is my first ever C++ and Qt application. I spent around 8 months creating the engine with multiple rewrites. It was difficult, but I'm proud of how much I was able to learn.",
